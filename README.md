Diï¬€erentially Private Generative Adversarial Networks for Time Series, Continuous, and Discrete Open Data

In this folder you can find an exhaustive explanation of the experiments that prove the flexibility and effectiveness of the DifferentiallyPrivate-GenerativeAdversarialNetwork framework. Our solution is able to release new open data while protecting the individuality of  the  users  through  a  strict  definition  of privacy called differential privacy. Unlike previous work, this paper provides a  framework  for  privacy  preserving  data  publishing  that  can  be easily adapted to different use cases, from the generation of time-series to continuous data, and discrete data.
